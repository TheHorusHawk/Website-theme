####Pelican theme for my Website

A modified version of the pelican theme notmyidea. [link](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/tree/master/pelican/themes/notmyidea)


It's very much geared for my personal needs. For example of use, see my website theHorusHawk.github.io.

Main changes: 
-Commented out author and date-modified from article_infos 
-Added support for comments with utterances
-Added some padding around article_infos
-Added custom page for about me, without comments
-changed the title for pages, to include a smaller sitename before the page title (articles remain the same)


Should you wish to use it, know it expects these variables on your config file
>Expects SITENAMESMALL variable to be set in config file.
>To use UTTERANCES, set UTTERANCES to True on your config file.
